Goal of this chapter: on top of Chapter 8 (RAG + Interrupt/Resume + Checkpoint), introduce the `skill` package, use `skill middleware` to inject and manage skills, so the Agent can discover and load a set of reusable skill documents (`SKILL.md`) and invoke them via tool calls when needed.

## Code Location

- Entry: [cmd/ch09/main.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/cmd/ch09/main.go)
- Sync script: [scripts/sync_eino_ext_skills.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/scripts/sync_eino_ext_skills.go)

## Prerequisites

- Same as Chapter 1: configure a working ChatModel (OpenAI or Ark)
- Prepare the skills documents provided by the `eino-ext` PR (`eino-guide` / `eino-component` / `eino-compose` / `eino-agent`)

`skill middleware` supports plugging in various skills. This chapter only uses the four eino-related skills as an example to demonstrate how to use `skill middleware` to integrate skills. Why these four?

ChatWithEino is positioned as "help users learn the Eino framework and assist with writing Eino code using AI." These four skill documents cover exactly the key knowledge areas needed for this goal.

Skill sources can be:

- The local path to the `eino-ext` repository (the script reads `<src>/skills/...` automatically)
- Or a directory where skills are already installed (containing the above subdirectories)

## From Graph Tool to Skill: Why "Skill Docs"

Chapter 8 solves "how to make a complex workflow callable as a Tool" (Graph Tool). But when building an agent for framework-learning/development assistance, you encounter another type of problem: **how to inject stable, reusable knowledge and instructions into the Agent, and let it load them on demand at runtime**.

That is the role of Skills:

- **Tool** is more like an "action/capability": read files, run workflows, call external systems
- **Skill** is more like a "reusable knowledge/instruction pack": a set of markdown files (`SKILL.md` + `reference/*.md`) describing "how to do something"

And `Skill middleware` is responsible for integrating skills into the agent. After registering the skill middleware, the Agent can read a specific Skill on demand via the `skill` tool.

Simple analogy:

- **Tool** = "what you can do" (function/interface)
- **Skill** = "how to do it" (reusable handbook/manual)

## Run

In the `quickstart/chatwitheino` directory:

### 1) Sync eino-ext skills to a local directory

To let the `skill` middleware "discover" these skills, place them under a unified directory following the scan convention:

- `EINO_EXT_SKILLS_DIR/<skillName>/SKILL.md`

Sync command (recommended):

```bash
go run ./scripts/sync_eino_ext_skills.go -src /path/to/eino-ext -dest ./skills/eino-ext -clean
```

Notes:

- `-src` supports two forms:
  - The root of the `eino-ext` repository (the script reads `<src>/skills/...` automatically)
  - A directory where skills are already installed (should contain `eino-guide/`, `eino-component/`, etc.)
- `-dest` defaults to `./skills/eino-ext` (can be omitted)

### 2) Start Chapter 9

```bash
export EINO_EXT_SKILLS_DIR=/absolute/path/to/chatwitheino/skills/eino-ext
go run ./cmd/ch09
```

Output example (snippet):

```
Skills dir: /.../skills/eino-ext
Enter your message (empty line to exit):
```

## Enable Skill in DeepAgent

Skill invocation does not happen automatically. You must register the `Skill middleware` when building the Agent. The core setup is three steps:

1. Use a local filesystem backend (this chapter uses `eino-ext/adk/backend/local`) to provide file reading/Glob capability
2. Use `skill.NewBackendFromFilesystem` to turn `EINO_EXT_SKILLS_DIR` into a Skill Backend
3. Use `skill.NewTyped[M]` to create a generic `Skill middleware` and attach it to DeepAgent's `Handlers`

**Key code snippet (note: this is simplified and not directly runnable; see cmd/ch09/main.go for full code):**

```go
backend, _ := localbk.NewBackend(ctx, &localbk.Config{})

skillBackend, _ := skill.NewBackendFromFilesystem(ctx, &skill.BackendFromFilesystemConfig{
    Backend: backend,
    BaseDir: skillsDir, // = $EINO_EXT_SKILLS_DIR
})
skillMiddleware, _ := skill.NewTyped[M](ctx, &skill.TypedConfig[M]{
    Backend: skillBackend,
})

agent, _ := deep.NewTyped[M](ctx, &deep.TypedConfig[M]{
    ChatModel: cm,
    Backend: backend,
    StreamingShell: backend,
    Handlers: []adk.TypedChatModelAgentMiddleware[M]{
        skillMiddleware,
        // ... other middlewares like approval/safeTool/retry
    },
})
```

Additional notes:

- This quickstart checks `EINO_EXT_SKILLS_DIR` existence at runtime to ensure "it runs even without skills configured": if the directory exists, it registers `skillMiddleware`; otherwise it skips it (the agent still works and can use RAG tools).
- The Skill tool's input is JSON: `{"skill": "<skillName>"}`, e.g. `{"skill":"eino-guide"}`.

## Quick Verification (Recommended)

After startup, send a prompt that explicitly asks the model to call the skill tool (to verify skills are discovered and loadable):

```
Use the skill tool with skill="eino-guide" and tell me what the entry point is for getting started.
```

You should see output similar to:

- `[tool result] Launching skill: eino-guide`
- Tool result includes `Base directory for this skill: .../eino-guide`

## What You Will See

- When the model calls the skill tool, the console prints:
  - `[tool call] ...`
  - `[tool result] ...` (truncated for display)
- Sessions are saved to `./data/sessions_agentic` by default and support resumption:
  - `go run ./cmd/ch09 --session <id>`
