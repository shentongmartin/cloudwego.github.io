title: "Chapter 11: TurnLoop — Preemption, Abort, and Multi-Turn Lifecycle"
weight: 11
---

In the previous chapter, we used `adk.Runner` to implement a complete A2UI Web application. It works fine, but try this scenario:

> You ask the Agent a complex question. It starts calling tools, generating a long answer... but you suddenly realize you asked the wrong thing and want to switch to a different question.

In the previous chapter's Runner mode, you can only wait for it to finish or refresh the page and lose everything.

This chapter introduces `adk.TurnLoop`, enabling two new user-facing capabilities for the Agent: **Preemption** and **Abort**.

## Prerequisites

Same as Chapter 1: You need to configure an available ChatModel (OpenAI or Ark). See the "Prerequisites" section in Chapter 1 for details.

## Running & Trying It Out

In the `quickstart/chatwitheino` directory, execute:

```bash
go run .
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`, then try the following:

### Experience Preemption

1. Send a question that triggers a long answer, e.g., "Explain all of Eino's components in detail"
2. **While the Agent is still answering**, send a new message directly, e.g., "Never mind, just tell me what ChatModel is"
3. Observe: The old answer stops immediately, and the Agent begins answering the new question

### Experience Abort

1. Send a question
2. **While the Agent is answering**, click the **Abort button** in the top-right corner
3. Observe: The Agent stops immediately and produces no further output

Neither of these capabilities existed in the previous chapter's Runner version. Below explains how they are implemented.

## Code Locations

- Entry code: [main.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/main.go)
- Agent construction: [agent.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/agent.go)
- TurnLoop server: [server/server.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/server/server.go)

## Why Runner Can't Do This

In the previous chapter's `cmd/ch10`, each `/sessions/:id/chat` request calls `runner.Run(ctx, messages)` once. Runner is a **single-turn** model — call once, execute once, finish. If a user sends another message while the Agent is executing, Runner has no "running loop" to receive it.

TurnLoop is a **persistent multi-turn execution loop**. It remains idle between turns, ready to receive new input via `Push()` and respond immediately. Because there is a continuously running loop, preemption and abort become possible — you can interrupt an ongoing turn or stop the entire loop.

<table>
<tr><td>Capability</td><td>Ch10 (Runner, single-turn)</td><td>Ch11 (TurnLoop, multi-turn)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Streaming output</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr>
<tr><td>Approval / interrupt</td><td>✅</td><td>✅</td></tr>
<tr><td>Persistent cross-turn execution, real-time response to new input</td><td>❌ Each Run() is independent</td><td>✅ Push() anytime</td></tr>
<tr><td>Preempt an ongoing answer</td><td>❌</td><td>✅ Push(item, WithPreempt(...))</td></tr>
<tr><td>Abort Agent</td><td>❌</td><td>✅ loop.Stop(WithImmediate())</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flexible per-turn input construction</td><td>❌ Business layer manually assembles</td><td>✅ GenInput callback</td></tr>
</table>

## TurnLoop's Core Model

TurnLoop is a **push-based event loop that manages Agent execution in units of turns**. Unlike Runner's "call once, execute once" model, TurnLoop runs continuously: after a turn ends, it enters idle wait; when a new item arrives, it immediately starts the next turn.

```
Push(item) → [queue] → GenInput(items) → Agent.Run() → OnAgentEvents(events)
                                ↑                              │
                                └──── idle wait / next turn ←──┘
```

Key concepts:

- **Item**: The carrier of user input. This example defines it as `ChatItem`, which can carry user messages or approval decisions
- **GenInput**: Builds Agent input from items in the queue (decides which items to consume and which to retain for the next turn)
- **OnAgentEvents**: Receives the Agent's output event stream, responsible for rendering and persistence
- **Push**: Pushes a new item to the queue, with optional preemption options

## One Session Corresponds to One TurnLoop

In this example's Web scenario, each chat session corresponds to one TurnLoop instance. When a user sends their first message, the server creates a TurnLoop for that session and calls `Run()` to start it; subsequent messages are fed into the same loop via `Push()`. The loop remains idle between turns until the session is deleted or the user aborts.

This is TurnLoop's most typical usage pattern: **the loop's lifecycle is bound to the user session**. A long-running TurnLoop makes preemption and abort natural operations — because the "running loop" always exists, new input can be fed in at any time.

## Normal Flow: idle → new message → answer → idle

The simplest scenario is the user asking questions sequentially, waiting for answers, then asking the next:

```go
// When the user sends the first message, create and start TurnLoop
loop := adk.NewTurnLoop(cfg)
loop.Push(&ChatItem{Query: "hello"})
loop.Run(ctx)
// → GenInput builds input → Agent executes → OnAgentEvents streams output
// → Turn ends, TurnLoop enters idle wait

// User sends second message (loop is idle at this point)
loop.Push(&ChatItem{Query: "explain Eino's architecture"})
// → TurnLoop wakes up, starts new turn: GenInput → Agent → OnAgentEvents → idle
```

This flow is no different from the previous chapter's Runner in terms of user experience — the difference is that TurnLoop's loop **persists** and doesn't need to be recreated each time. Once a user sends a new message while the Agent is still answering, we enter the "preemption" scenario below.

## How Preemption Works

When a user sends a new message while the Agent is answering, the business layer only needs one line of code to trigger preemption:

```go
loop.Push(item, adk.WithPreempt[*ChatItem, M](adk.AfterToolCalls))
```

After TurnLoop receives this instruction:

1. Waits for the current tool call to complete (`AfterToolCalls` means don't interrupt an executing tool to avoid inconsistent state)
2. Cancels the current turn — OnAgentEvents' context is cancelled, the old turn exits
3. Takes the new item from the queue, builds input via GenInput, starts a new turn

Preemption mode allows choosing different safe points based on business needs:

<table>
<tr><td>Mode</td><td>Specific Behavior</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AfterToolCalls</strong></td><td>Waits for the currently executing tool calls to complete, then cancels the current turn and starts a new turn</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AfterChatModel</strong></td><td>Waits for the current LLM call to complete, then cancels the current turn and starts a new turn</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>AnySafePoint</strong></td><td>Immediately cancels the current turn at any safe point (e.g., between tool calls, between model calls) and starts a new turn</td></tr>
</table>

> In this example, TurnLoop runs in a separate goroutine while the HTTP handler needs to write the event stream to the SSE response. The two coordinate via channels (see `iterEnvelope`/`iterResult` and the `handlerDone` signaling mechanism in [server/server.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/server/server.go)). These are HTTP adaptation layer details, not part of the TurnLoop API itself.

## How Abort Works

Abort is simpler — directly stop the entire TurnLoop:

```go
loop.Stop(adk.WithImmediate())  // Cancel immediately without waiting for current turn
loop.Wait()                     // Wait for complete exit
```

### Three Modes of Stop

<table>
<tr><td>Mode</td><td>Specific Behavior</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>loop.Stop()</strong></td><td>Turn-boundary exit: waits for the current turn to complete before exiting</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>loop.Stop(WithImmediate())</strong></td><td>Immediate exit: cancels the current turn's context</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>loop.Stop(WithGraceful())</strong></td><td>Safe-point exit: exits at the next safe point (e.g., between tool calls)</td></tr>
</table>

## TurnLoop Configuration

When creating a TurnLoop, specify callbacks and options via `TurnLoopConfig`:

```go
cfg := adk.TurnLoopConfig[*ChatItem, M]{
    // GenInput: Called at the start of each turn, decides "what the Agent sees this turn"
    // Selects items from the queue to build Agent input, returns Consumed (processed this turn) and Remaining (kept for later turns)
    GenInput: func(ctx context.Context, loop *adk.TurnLoop[*ChatItem, M], items []*ChatItem) (*adk.GenInputResult[*ChatItem, M], error) {
        // ...build AgentInput, persist user messages...
    },

    // PrepareAgent: Called once per turn, returns the Agent to use for this turn
    // This example returns the same Agent, but you can dynamically select different Agents based on items
    PrepareAgent: func(ctx context.Context, loop *adk.TurnLoop[*ChatItem, M], consumed []*ChatItem) (adk.TypedAgent[M], error) {
        return agent, nil
    },

    // OnAgentEvents: Receives the Agent's event stream, responsible for rendering output and persisting intermediate messages
    // This example transfers the event stream to the HTTP handler via channel for SSE output
    OnAgentEvents: func(ctx context.Context, tc *adk.TurnContext[*ChatItem, M], events *adk.AsyncIterator[*adk.TypedAgentEvent[M]]) error {
        // ...pass events to HTTP handler, wait for consumption to complete...
    },

    // The following three fields are for declarative checkpoint (approval recovery), detailed in the next section
    GenResume:    makeGenResume(),
    Store:        checkpointStore,
    CheckpointID: sessionID,
}

loop := adk.NewTurnLoop(cfg)
```

<table>
<tr><td>Callback</td><td>Invocation Timing</td><td>Responsibility</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>GenInput</strong></td><td>When items exist in the queue</td><td>Select which items to consume, build Agent input (can decide which items to retain for the next turn)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>PrepareAgent</strong></td><td>After GenInput</td><td>Return the Agent instance for this turn, supports dynamic Agent configuration adjustment</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>OnAgentEvents</strong></td><td>When Agent produces event stream</td><td>Consume events, render output, persist results — the core entry point for business-layer Agent output processing</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>GenResume</strong></td><td>When resuming from checkpoint</td><td>Extract approval results from newly Pushed items, construct <pre>ResumeParams</pre>, automating approval recovery</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Store + CheckpointID</strong></td><td>—</td><td>Enable declarative checkpoint; TurnLoop automatically handles saving and restoring execution state</td></tr>
</table>

## Declarative Checkpoint: Automating Approval Recovery

In Chapter 7 (Runner mode), approval recovery required the business layer to manually call `runner.ResumeWithParams()` and determine whether "this is a normal execution or a recovery execution." TurnLoop provides a more concise approach — declare `Store` and `CheckpointID` in the configuration (see previous section), and TurnLoop automatically handles saving and restoration:

1. When Agent execution reaches an approval interrupt, TurnLoop automatically saves execution state to `Store` (keyed by `CheckpointID`)
2. After the user makes an approval decision, the business layer creates a new TurnLoop (using the **same** `CheckpointID`) and Pushes the approval item
3. When the new TurnLoop `Run()`s, it detects the checkpoint exists and **automatically calls `GenResume`** (instead of `GenInput`) to obtain recovery parameters
4. The Agent resumes execution from the interrupt point

`GenResume`'s responsibility is to extract approval results from newly Pushed items and construct `ResumeParams`:

```go
GenResume: func(ctx context.Context, loop *adk.TurnLoop[*ChatItem, M],
    canceledItems, unhandledItems, newItems []*ChatItem,
) (*adk.GenResumeResult[*ChatItem, M], error) {
    // newItems contains the item Pushed during approval recovery
    item := newItems[0]
    return &adk.GenResumeResult[*ChatItem, M]{
        ResumeParams: &adk.ResumeParams{
            InterruptID: item.InterruptID,
            ApprovalResult: item.ApprovalResult,
        },
    }, nil
}
```

Compared to Runner's `ResumeWithParams()`, declarative checkpoint frees the business layer from managing the "normal execution vs. recovery execution" branching — TurnLoop automatically chooses between `GenInput` and `GenResume` based on whether a checkpoint exists.

## Chapter Summary

- **TurnLoop** is a persistent multi-turn execution loop whose lifecycle is bound to the user session
- **Normal flow**: `Push(item)` → GenInput → Agent → OnAgentEvents → idle → wait for next Push
- **Preemption**: `Push(item, WithPreempt(AfterToolCalls))` — one line of code cancels the current turn and starts a new one
- **Abort**: `loop.Stop(WithImmediate())` — one line of code terminates the entire loop
- **Declarative checkpoint**: Configure `Store` + `CheckpointID`, and TurnLoop automatically handles interrupt saving and restoration
- For specific callback implementations, see [server/server.go](https://github.com/cloudwego/eino-examples/blob/main/quickstart/chatwitheino/server/server.go)

## Series Conclusion: Complete Agent Application Skeleton

By this chapter, we've used a runnable Agent to connect Eino's core capabilities:

- **Runtime**: Runner / TurnLoop drives execution, supporting streaming output, preemption, and abort
- **Tool layer**: Filesystem / Shell and other Tool capabilities integrated, tool errors handled safely
- **Middleware**: Pluggable middleware/handlers for cross-cutting capabilities like error handling, retry, and approval
- **Observability**: callbacks/trace capabilities connecting key paths for debugging and production observability
- **Human-AI collaboration**: interrupt/resume + checkpoint supporting approval, parameter completion, branch selection, and other interactive flows
- **Deterministic orchestration**: compose (graph/chain/workflow) organizes complex business flows into maintainable, reusable execution graphs
- **Business delivery**: A2UI protocol presents Agent capabilities to users as streaming UI
- **Execution control**: TurnLoop provides preemption, abort, and multi-turn lifecycle management, adapting to complex interaction needs in real business scenarios

You can progressively replace/extend any component on this skeleton: model, tools, storage, workflows, frontend rendering protocol — without starting from scratch.
